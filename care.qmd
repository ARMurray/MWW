### Cutting Boards

If you purchased a cutting board or some other food-serving item like a charcuterie tray, we use mineral oil and then a combination of orange oil and beeswax. We **do not** recommend that you ever wash your board with soap. To clean, wipe off with warm water and towel off to dry. If you scrub the board, avoid using things like steel wool. A sponge, soft-bristled brush, or woven pads are fine. When we finish our boards, we apply mineral oil and wipe it into the wood with a soft cloth. We let that dry for about 30 minutes, then rub in the combination orange oil and beeswax. You can use either of these products or both. Mineral oil can be found at your local drug store, the brand does not matter. Any beeswax or orange oil product is fine too. We typically use Howard's 'Feed-N-Wax', which can be found at most hardware stores.
